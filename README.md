# NDS Snake Console game
A simple snake console game I decided to write for the Nintendo DS Lite. This isn't meant to be actually released/shipped for public use, it's simply written for my own benefit,
to improve my C++ skills. So far I've enjoyed writing it, and challenging myself by implementing data structures such as an XOR linked list. (For the snake's tail)

Feel free to copy this code, though if you use my XOR-linked list 'remove' function, please credit me at least :D That took me days to develop ;)

Note that save data is still unimplemented. A high-score system is planned to hopefully be done in the future, and saved into the .SAV file.

To run the game, simply upload the .nds file to your NDS using some form of card such as an R4. If you do not own an NDS, or wish to just test it,
consider installing the DeSmuMe emulator. (Which i believe is included in one of the packages required to actually develop for NDS.)

If you wish to work on the project, but are unsure where to start, consider following the first few episodes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jciWeBoEyk">this tutorial</a>, 
despite the guy's terrible microphone volume. The video will show you how to go about installing DevKitPro, etc...
